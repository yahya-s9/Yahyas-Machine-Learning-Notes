- came out last week
- ask question:
	- in robotic manipulation, we don't have access to a lot of expert data, iomitation learing onlymakes sense if u have near optimal demosntrations, but we can get suboptimal data cheaper, preforms better than expensive expert level data
	- how to combine the two to get a better policy?
	- focus on robotic manipulation setting. 
	- low "data regime"
	- most ppl have tons of non-expert data, less expert level data.
	- offline RL gas promise that without access to simulator, u can lewarn offline without needing simulation in a causal way a policy that preforms well
	- intuition for offline RL is that u can stitch partial demonstrations
- approaches:
	- use all data that u have, but spend time in curation, filtering, to data thats near optimal. but that takes a lot of work
	- can we use cheaper sources of data without filtering to improve imitation learning?
- offline rl
	- treats all data as arbitrary off policy data
	- learn better policy through rewards and temporal diff learning
	- be pessimistic ab value function so u don't deviate outside of data distrbution
	- need a good reward fuction
	- less need for simulator.
	- do rl without a simulator, based on dynamic programming, learn stitching, impose pessimism bias.
	- also there is model based offline rl.
- online rl
	- need a good simulator
	- access to reward function
- proposal:
	- SQIL (soft queue imitiation learning) prev paper : if u need RL in closed loop, treat data that u want to imitiate as off policy data. things u want to imitate get rewarded. applied it in online RL setting (in a simulation)
	- take that idea, do offline RL, intuition that the model would learn through stitching to recover from bad state to expert state distribution.
	- issue: 
		- sparse reward, and no simulator means less sample efficiency.
		- if HD state action space ur cooked.
	- so high level u say choose what to imitate / non imitate
	- two regularization tricks to make it work in HD state action space
- IMPQL: implicit diffusion q learning

- questions
	- stitching?
		- u have a bunch of demonstrations that yuve seen
		- cost function tells how good these are
		- in earlier training u saw bad demonstrations, in early part of maze
		- then later saw good demonstations later, cost tells u which one good
		- stitching = stitch good early on, and good later on.
		- eventually learn policy: pick good from begining and end.
	- Why stitching not happenign in regularl RL?
		- this is still regular rl but not with a simulator in this case

	- state action space?
	- diffusion model v a gaussian model?
	- A question is, are the policies learned via offline RL using non-expert data via this technique, comparable in performance to policies learned from solely expert data? 
		- if u use this approach, (expert + non expert) is better than only using expert data, depending on data set size
